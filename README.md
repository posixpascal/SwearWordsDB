# A database with swear words
This repository contains swear words which can be used in obscenity filters like [this one](https://github.com/michaelglass/obscenity).
Feel free to contribute more swear words to this repository via **Pull Requests**.

Put **common swear words** into `{locale}/swdb.txt` seperated by a `LINEFEED (\n)`
You may put exotic swear words into `{locale}/swdb.extended.txt`. 

I will add scripts to simplify the adding process soon.
